        <h2 class="whoIs">Who is Christian Anguiano?</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Christian Anguiano. I am a web developer in training with growing skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The Grand Course is my first project in web development and it is also my final project for the General Assembly Front End Web Development course. I hope you enjoyed what The Grand Course currently has to offer and I am so glad you had that you were able to visit.</p>

        <h2>What inspired me to create The Grand Course?</h2>
        <p>There were many inspirations and ideas along the way of finishing this project. Though the project isn't quite finished, I was able to make use of the different ideas that I had throughout the project. From the names of characters and objects to the overall story and design. I am proud by how much I was able to include and come up with for this project and I hope more to come in the future.</p>

        <h2>What's coming to The Grand Course?</h2>
        <p>Now that The Grand Course is playable and the site is up and running, I am so excited to share ideas I have to expand the experience. This includes 2 future new characters and new enemies to protect yourself against. Then dont forget to keep up with The World News and see whats happening in The Grand Course story. We hope you check back to see enjoy our updates! </p>
